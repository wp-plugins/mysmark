Description: 
This is a WordPress plugin which allows users to comment and to give emotional 
feedbacks about your posts through MySmark services (www.mysmark.com).

Installation:
In order to get this plugin to work properly you need to obtain MySmark OAuth 
credentials (necessary to use MySmark APIs). Register to mysmark.com, go to the 
business account page and click API access, it will provide your credentials 
(OAuth client ID and OAuth client secret). Now simply move the files from this 
archive into YOUR_WORDPRESS_PATH/wp-content/plugins/MySmark (please pay 
attention to capital letters). Open your Wordpress administrator page and 
activate the MySmark plugin. You're almost done. Go to the MySmark control 
panel or click on the link provided by the warning in you admin pages, insert 
your OAuth credentials you created before and that's it, your Wordpress posts 
are ready to be smarked.

Notes:

features introduced.
